## Demo

This demo will only work for credit card payments. Digital wallets are not supported locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/square/react-square-payment-form.git
cd react-square-payment-form/demo
npm install
npm start
```

You will need to set the `LOCATION_ID` and `APPLICATION_ID` in `PaymentPage.jsx` to your own application credentials.
